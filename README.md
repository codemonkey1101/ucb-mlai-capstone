## Problem:

Looking to answer the question of what is the least amount of money required for an NFL team to make it to the playoffs.  This gets broken down into the following questions:
- what offensive statistics have the most effect on a teams ability to score points (i.e. passing yardage per pass attempt, running yardage per run attempt, interceptions, etc).  Same question for defensive statistics.
- what is the average number of points scored vs points allowed for an NFL team to win a game.
- what is the distribution of cost per player position that most effects a teams ability to score points as well as prevent the opposing team from scoring points.
- on average how many games need to be won for a team to make it to the playoffs.
 
NOTE: The cost of special-teams is merged into offense and defense.

## Data:

- NFL team statistics from https://data.scorenetwork.org/football/nfl-team-statistics.html : nfl-team-statistics.csv (circa. 1999 thru 2022).  This data defines game related statistics per year and team such as points scored, points allowed, total rushing yards, etc.
- Scraped data from the website: https://overthecap.com/positional-spending#y2013 thru https://overthecap.com/positional-spending#y2022.  This data shows how much money each team spent per team, player position and year.
- Kaggle data set containing list of NFL teams that made it to the playoffs between 2013 and 2022
  - Data from 2013 thru 2021: NFL_team_playoff_perc_win_data.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanyachaubey/nfl20102021offdefplayoffteamstats?resource=download).
  - Teams that made the playoffs in 2022:
    - Philadelphia Eagles
    - San Francisco 49ers

## Techniques:

### Feature Analysis:
- Correlation Matrix (using Heatmap): The method parameter specifies the type of correlation to calculate, and it can be one of the following:
  - 'pearson' (default): Standard correlation coefficient, measures linear relationship
  - 'kendall': Kendall Tau correlation coefficient, non-parametric measure, suitable for non-normal data or ordinal data
  - 'spearman': Spearman rank correlation, non-parametric measure, assesses monotonic relationships
  - callable: User-defined function to calculate correlation.
- Scikit-Learn Permutation Feature Importance
-

- NOTE:  The EPA variables are advanced NFL statistics, conveying how much value a team is adding over the average team in a given situation. Itâ€™s on a points scale instead of the typically used yards scale, because not all yards are created equal in American football (10 yard gain on 3rd and 15 is much less valuable than a 2 yard gain on 4th and 1). For offensive stats the higher the EPA the better, but for defensive stats the lower (more negative) the EPA the better. The WPA variables are similar except they are measuring play value in terms of win probability.

### Approach
- created baseline for 4 classifier model types: KNN, DecisionTree, SVC and RandomForest.
- indentified best feature set using permutation importance and the calculation of CCP-Alpha for the DecisionTree and RandomForsest classifiers.
- all models were trained to predict the MadePlayoffs feature where 1 = True and 0 = False.  The training data used all available features accept for feature associated with COST.
- The final comparison was based on root mean squared error (RMSE) and accuracy, where the best models were tie breakers were based on their predictions.  This was determined using a confusion matrix.

### Results:
When comparing the following models the best model use the DecisionTreeClassifier and had the following configuration: 
- hyper-params:                               {}
- ccp-alpha:                            0.011719
- impurities:                           0.070343
- nodes:                                       9
- depth:                                       4
- training score:                       0.960938
- test score:                           0.921875
- rmse:                                 0.241812
- test confusion matrix:      [[36, 0], [5, 23]]
- feature count:                              54

It should be noted that no suggested feature selection from the permutation importance results was implemented in this model.

With that said, a close runner up also used the DecisionTreeClassifier model type.  The differentiator was the error which was slighlty higher probably due to the use of less features.
Here the suggested feature set from permutation importance was implemented where the model type used was also a DecisionTreeClassifier.
